      "changelog": "CloudViewer 0.3.7 introduces a brand new 3D Machine Learning module, nicknamed CloudViewer-ML. CloudViewer-ML is an extension of your favorite library to bring support for 3D domain-specific operators, models, algorithms, and datasets. In a nutshell, users can now create new applications combining the power of 3D data and state-of-the-art neural networks! CloudViewer-ML is included in all the binary releases of CloudViewer 0.3.7. \n CloudViewer-ML comes with support for Pytorch +1.4 and TensorFlow +2.2, the two most popular machine learning frameworks. The first iteration of this module features a 3D semantic segmentation toolset, including training and inference capabilities for RandlaNet and KPConv. The toolset supports popular datasets such as SemanticKITTI, Semantic3D, 3D Semantic Parsing of Large-Scale Indoor Spaces S3DIS, Toronto3D, Paris-Lille-3D and Electricity3D. CloudViewer-ML also provides a new model zoo compatible with Pytorch and TensorFlow, so that users can enjoy state-of-the-art semantic segmentation models without hassles. \n We have endowed the new CloudViewer-ML module with a new data viewer tool. Users can now inspect their datasets and model’s predictions in an intuitive and simple way. This visualization tool includes support for Pytorch and TensorFlow frameworks and is fully customizable due to its Pythonic nature. \n This viewer has been built upon the new visualization API, integrating the new Rendering and GUI modules. Thanks to the new visualization API, users can perform advanced rendering, fully programmatically from Python and C++. Users can also create slick GUIs with a few lines of Python code. Check out how to do this here. \n We hope you find CloudViewer 0.3.7 exciting and useful. Happy coding!",
